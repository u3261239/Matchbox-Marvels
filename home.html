				<h2>Looking Back at Matchbox International</h2>
				<p>Matchbox is a brand of die-cast toy cars first introduced by Lesney Products in the UK in 1953. 
					The name "Matchbox" was chosen because the original toys were sold in boxes similar in size and shape 
					to the boxes in which matches were sold. Matchbox cars quickly became popular around the world, and in 
					1969 the brand was acquired by Mattel. Over the years, Matchbox has produced a wide range of vehicles,
					 including cars, trucks, planes, and more, and has become a beloved part of many people's childhood memories.
					  Today, Matchbox continues to produce high-quality die-cast toys that are loved by kids and collectors alike.</p>
